## 1. Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>

As fears of an upcoming recession in the USA ramp up, our group conducted an in-depth analysis of various assetâ€™s performance throughout the previous three recessionary environments. We utilized the S&P 500 as the benchmark to measure each other asset against. We included a diverse group of assets in attempt to capture the entirety of the market. Of the twelve assets analyzed, we chose six equity sectors, the ten-year treasury, gold, oil, USD, and the CBOE volatility index. The goal was to reveal the overall impact of a recession on each asset and define any trends or relationships among classes and across recession periods. Our group aimed to discover market tendencies which could lead to further insight into future recessions and guide capital providers on how to protect their investments.

### a. Current Market Environment in America <a name="Market"></a>

Since mid-2022, a heated debate has been taking place among politicians, economists, and market experts regarding the future of the US economy, and whether it is headed towards a recession or not. The argument is often swayed by political affiliations and hinges on the interpretation of the word "recession".

According to a widely accepted definition of recession, two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth would signal a recession, which would have started in the summer of 2022. However, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the organization responsible for defining US business cycles, does not agree with this assessment. The NBER views a recession as a substantial decrease in economic activity across the country that persists for more than a few months, and does not believe that a recession occurred in the summer of 2022.

Despite this disagreement, the possibility of a recession still looms in the near future. The Federal Reserve has expressed its intention to increase interest rates until inflation begins to cool down from its current state, which could trigger a downturn in the economy that would be universally recognized as a recession.

Economic Data from the Most Recent Reports:
 - GDP Q4 2022 +2.9% (good)
 - CPI December +6.5% (bad)
 - Treasury Yield Curve 10Y/2Y Spread -0.66% (inverted, bad)
 - Unemployment Rate December 3.5% (good)
 - Initial Jobless Claims January 190,000 (good)
 - Housing Starts December -1.4% (bad)

### b. Project Objectives <a name="Objectives"></a>

- Analyze the performance of major indices, sectors, and securities throughout past recessions
- Calculate steepest decline (or incline) for the assets from peak to trough in each recession
- Calculate the percentage of value decrease (or increase) over the course of the recession
- Calculate the time to recovery (pre-recession levels) for each asset
- Report any intermarket relationship or correlations findings
- Utilize findings to provide guidance into future recessionary environments
