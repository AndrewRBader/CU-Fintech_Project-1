## 1. Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>

As fears of an upcoming recession in the USA ramp up, our group conducted an in-depth analysis of various asset’s performance throughout the previous three recessionary environments. We utilized the S&P 500 as the benchmark to measure each other asset against. We included a diverse group of assets in attempt to capture the entirety of the market. Of the twelve assets analyzed, we chose six equity sectors, the ten-year treasury, gold, oil, USD, and the CBOE volatility index. The goal was to reveal the overall impact of a recession on each asset and define any trends or relationships among classes and across recession periods. Our group aimed to discover market tendencies which could lead to further insight into future recessions and guide capital providers on how to protect their investments.
