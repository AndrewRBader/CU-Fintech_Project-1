Monte Carlo Forecasts vs S&P 500 Actual Historical Returns

In any given 10 year period, how does the simulation match up to the actual returns of the index?

Group will evaluate the efficacy of monte carlo simulation utilizing historical S&P 500 (since 1930). The program will allow the user to select a starting time point based on which the report of expected 10 year returns will be generated. We will buidl a visualization of the forecasted mean return and confidence intervals and finally comparing these to the actual returns.

Actually going to test if this is a viable method.

Using 10 year simulation, start from 1930...
- Run sim for 1930 - 1940, get results (summary stat - mean return). Also get realized returns.
- Run sim for 1940 - 1950, get results. Also get realized returns.
- Run sim for 1950 - 1960, get results. Also get realized returns.
