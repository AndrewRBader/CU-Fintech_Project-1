Asset Class Performance Against the Stock Market During Past 3 Recessions

User Story:
•	In fears of an upcoming recession in the USA, our group is conducting an in-depth analysis of various asset’s performance throughout the previous 3 recessionary environments using the S&P 500 as the benchmark to measure against. The goal is to reveal the overall impact of a recession on each asset and define any trends or relationships among classes and across recession periods. The group aims to discover market tendencies which could lead to further insight into future recessions and guide capital providers on how to protect their investments.

Objectives:
•	Analyze the performance of major indices, sectors, and securities throughout past recessions
•	Calculate steepest decline (or incline) for the assets from peak to trough in each recession
•	Calculate the percentage of value decrease (or increase) over the course of the recession
•	Calculate the time to recovery (pre-recession levels) for each asset
•	Calculate the averages among each recession to exhibit the overall performance of an asset
•	Report any intermarket relationship or correlations findings
•	Display results in visual formats and charts
•	Utilize findings to provide guidance into future recessionary environments
