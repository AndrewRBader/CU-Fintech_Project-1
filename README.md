## 1. Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>

In fears of an upcoming recession in the USA, our group is conducting an in-depth analysis of various asset’s performance throughout the previous 3 recessionary environments using the S&P 500 as the benchmark to measure against. The goal is to reveal the overall impact of a recession on each asset and define any trends or relationships among classes and across recession periods. The group aims to discover market tendencies which could lead to further insight into future recessions and guide capital providers on how to protect their investments.
