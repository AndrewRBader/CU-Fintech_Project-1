Data Cleaning Portion of the project by Andrew Bader

In this folder, the original csv files from the Resources folder were imported, cleaned, and saved to csv files in the clean-data folder within the Resources directory.

Python automation was utilized to clean, process, and save the resultant csv's

Each file required cleaning algorithms to either get rid of characters such as commas, dashes and required conversion from strings to floats

As each data file was cleaned, I also checked "plotability" of each resultant, cleaned file before data analytics were applied with the hvplot library

The cleaned data was then used for resultant analysis
